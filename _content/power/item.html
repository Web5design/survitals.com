<p>An emergency power source creates the ability to generate power on command in the event of a power grid failure.
  With the rise in erratic weather patterns and the evergrowing demand on an outdated energy grid power failures are 
  becoming more common.  These power outages range from a few hours to weeks on end.  There are many options available

<h2>Simple Solutions</h2>
  <li>Charcoal Grill or Outdoor Fire Pit</li>
  
    <p>The most basic source of emergency power is fire.  A simple outdoor fire pit or charcoal grill will allow 
      anyone to heat canned food, cook raw meat and vegetables, and most importantly boil water.  The grill or fire pit 
      also creates welcome warmth that can easily raise the spirits and become a focal and rallying point during a 
      survival situation.
