<p>An emergency power source creates the ability to generate power on command in the event of a power grid failure.
  With the rise in erratic weather patterns and the evergrowing demand on an outdated energy grid power failures are 
  becoming more common.  These power outages range from a few hours to weeks on end.  There are many options available
  to provide emergency power to the homeowner and each has its advantages and disadvantages but with careful planning 
  a proper system can be installed within most budgets.
