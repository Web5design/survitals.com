        suggests situation awareness is more a mindset than a skill:
    </figcaption>
    <blockquote>
        The <b>primary</b> element in establishing this mindset is first to recognize that threats exist. 
        Ignorance or denial of a threat make a person's chances of quickly recognizing an emerging 
        threat and avoiding it highly unlikely. Bad things do happen. Apathy, denial and complacency 
        can be deadly. A <b>second</b> important element of the proper mindset is understanding the need to 
        take responsibility for one's own security.
